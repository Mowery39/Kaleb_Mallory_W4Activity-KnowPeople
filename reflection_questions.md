# Reflection Questions 

## Briefly describe your approach to this activity
I used the Cultural Artifacts Know People method to understand big-box club store shoppers by examining common objects, behaviors, and routines associated with stores like Costco and Sam’s Club. Rather than interviewing users directly, I focused on patterns revealed through shared artifacts and shopping behaviors.

## User Needs: Pains, Gains, and Jobs
### Who are the different user personas of a big-box club store?
- Budget-Focused Family Shopper – Shops for a household and prioritizes long-term savings through bulk purchases.
- Small Business or Side-Hustle Shopper – Uses big-box stores as a supply source for business or resale needs.
- Value-Driven Individual Shopper – Selectively buys bulk items that fit personal or shared living situations.

## What tasks or objectives are the users attempting to complete (jobs)?
- Stock up on household essentials efficiently
- Reduce overall grocery and supply costs
- Purchase trusted brands in large quantities
- Minimize the frequency of shopping trips

## What benefit or need do users get (gains)?
- Lower cost per unit compared to traditional stores
- Convenience of buying in bulk
- Consistent product quality
- Ability to complete most shopping in one trip

## What discomfort or difficulty do users need to accept (pains)?
- Crowded store layouts and high foot traffic
- Long checkout and receipt-check lines
- Limited product variety
- Membership fees
- Storage challenges at home

## What method did you select and why?
I selected the Cultural Artifacts method because it allowed me to identify user motivations and needs through observable behaviors and physical objects without requiring direct interaction or interviews.

## What is the step-by-step procedure you used for the method?
- 1. Identified common artifacts associated with big-box club shopping
- 2. Observed recurring behaviors linked to these artifacts
- 3. Grouped observations into distinct user personas
- 4. Mapped user jobs, gains, and pains
- 5. Summarized findings into a single-page design artifact

## Adjustments from the book:
I relied on prior experiences and publicly observable patterns rather than formal probes or interviews, adjusting the method to fit a short, exploratory activity.

## How could your findings be presented in a clearer way?
The findings could be clearer by using stronger visual grouping and clearer labels to separate personas, jobs, gains, and pains.

## How would you rate the visual salience/hierarchy of information in your report? What could you do to improve it?
The visual hierarchy is clear, but could be improved by making the listed answers look more appealing to help guide the reader’s attention.

## If you had to restart and do this activity again, is there anything you would do differently?WSSS
I would observe shoppers at different times and compare multiple big-box stores to see how behaviors vary across locations and conditions.
